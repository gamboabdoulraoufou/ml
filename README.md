# Machine learning practice

## Project description
I work on personal activity data from devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit.
The goal of my project is to predict the manner in which the exercise was done.

##Â Data Source
The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

## Modeling
After sampling the data into two samples (training_train and training_test), I built a model on the training_train and I validate this model on the training_test.
### build model
To build my model I used the random forest algorihtm.
### Focast
After validation stape, i use my model to forcast news values.
