		<h4>Modeling</h4>
		<p>After sampling thetraining sample in two sample (training_train and training_test), I built a 
		model on the training_train and I validate this modele on my training_test sample .</p>
		<h5>build model</h5>
		<p>To build my model I used the random forest .</p>
		<h5>validate model</h5>
		<h5>Focast</h5>
		<p>After validation stape, i use my model to forcast news values</p>
